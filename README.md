# Google Earth Engine (GEE) Code Repository

## Introduction
This repository houses a curated collection of Google Earth Engine scripts utilized for a range of geospatial and remote sensing analyses. These scripts are particularly focused on environmental monitoring and analyzing satellite imagery to derive meaningful insights about vegetation, temperature variations, and other ecological indicators.

## Featured Analyses
- **NDVI Calculation:** Scripts for assessing vegetation health and density using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index derived from satellite imagery.
- **Temperature Difference Analysis:** Tools to evaluate temperature changes over time and across different geographical regions.
- **Additional Analyses:** Include water quality indices, soil moisture studies, and urban heat island effect evaluations, among others.

## Usage
Each script in the repository is documented to explain its purpose, the data it uses, and the outputs it generates. To use these scripts:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine or access it within the Google Earth Engine code editor.
2. Make sure you have access to the required datasets, either via GEE's data catalog or by uploading your own.
3. Run the scripts in the Google Earth Engine IDE or adapt them as necessary for your specific analysis needs.
